\addsec{Acknowledgments}

I’d like to sincerely thank my supervisor, Professor Veronika Ritzer, for her patience and for the many insightful ideas that challenged and inspired me. Her support and feedback were crucial in shaping this work and keeping me motivated throughout my bachelor's thesis.

My deepest gratitude goes to my parents. Without their constant encouragement and support, pursuing my studies would not have been possible. Their belief in me, throughout my academic career and beyond, has meant everything.

And finally, a very special thank you to Sofia. Meeting her during my studies was a turning point, and I am so grateful for the life we’ve built together. Over the past few years, we’ve tackled countless challenges side by side, and her dedicated presence and support, especially during this thesis, have made an immeasurable difference.
