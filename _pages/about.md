Driven by the vision of designing intuitive and future-oriented user experiences, I combine technical understanding with creative design competence. My mission is to create real added value through user-centric solutions and to sustainably improve digital interaction.

I am currently a Master's student in **User Experience Design** at **Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt** (expected graduation 2026), having previously completed my Bachelor's degree there with a grade of 1.2. My academic journey is complemented by practical experience, including an internship as a **Creative Technologist** at **BMW AG** in Munich, where I focused on developing future-oriented solutions and prototypes in the Design-Technology department. Prior to my studies, I worked as an IT Specialist for System Integration at Helios Kliniken Mittelweser GmbH.

My skill set bridges design and technology, with proficiency in tools like **Figma**, **ProtoPie**, **Unity**, and Adobe Creative Cloud, as well as programming languages such as **HTML/CSS**, **C++**, and **Java**. I am also experienced in User Research, Usability Testing, and Agile Software Development.

I am fluent in German (native), English (fluent), and Italian (fluent).
